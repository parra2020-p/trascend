    <h1>Catalina Catana</h1>
    <small>Academic Coordinator</small>
    <p>Passionate about learning design, future of work and entrepreneurship, Catalina
      wants to empower the millennial generation to unlock its potential, engage in a
      lifelong learning experience and facilitate the transition from university to the
      professional world. 
    </p>
    <p>Catalina has been envisioning a social innovation/social entrepreneurship
      education for young people for a few years now, but the time and place never felt right. Moving
      to Vietnam to make a dream come true has become more urgent, and meeting Andres was a clear
      sign that the time is NOW! So she has joined the team to kickstart this together and empower
      young people to become changemakers in their communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catalina is now working at Think Zone in Hanoi leading their accelerator program for mindful
      startups. And in Transcend, she will be helping the team with strategizing, developing the first
      draft of the curriculum, and overall managing and supporting the club.
